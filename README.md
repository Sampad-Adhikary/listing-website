Welcome to the Web3 Resources repository! This is an open-source collection of tools and resources related to web3 development. Feel free to contribute by adding more tools or updating existing information.

## Tools

### 4. Hardhat

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a powerful and extensible development environment for Ethereum that facilitates smart contract development, testing, and deployment. It provides a set of tools and tasks to streamline the Ethereum development process, making it easier for developers to build robust decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Key Features:**
- **Smart Contract Development:** Hardhat simplifies the process of writing, compiling, and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Testing Environment:** It offers a built-in testing environment that enables developers to create and run tests for their smart contracts, ensuring code integrity and functionality.
- **Scripting and Task Automation:** Hardhat supports custom scripts and tasks, allowing developers to automate common development tasks and workflows, enhancing efficiency.
- **Ethereum Network Management:** Developers can easily switch between different Ethereum networks (e.g., mainnet, testnets) for testing and deployment purposes.
- **Extensibility:** Hardhat is highly extensible, allowing developers to integrate additional plugins and tools to tailor the development environment to their specific needs.
- **Built-in Console:** Hardhat provides a built-in console for interacting with deployed smart contracts, making it convenient for developers to test and debug their code.
- **Integration with Web3 Libraries:** Seamless integration with Web3 libraries facilitates interaction with Ethereum nodes and smart contracts from within the development environment.

### 1. MetaMask

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is a popular Ethereum wallet and gateway to decentralized applications. It allows users to manage their Ethereum-based assets and interact with the growing ecosystem of web3 applications.

**Key Features:**
